       "1.0      False     01 12, 2010  AO2EURP2Y4JZM   B002PDPIF2  Karl           Intuit continues its downhill slide in quality control and user irritation across their product line with Quicken Deluxe 2010 (Windows).\\n\\nThe most infuriating thing about upgrading to this version is that it introduced literally dozens of categories into my data file without even asking me.  My categories ('accounts' in accounting parlance) have been in use satisfactorily for many years and I had no need for these crazy new ones that Quicken 2010 inserted:  \"Ads\", \"Car\" (I had \"Auto\" and subs), dozens of \"Biz\" entries, etc.  My memorized reports all ask me what to do about the new categories, they show up in lists, etc ... so I'm busy purging them all at the moment...\\n\\nReadability of various screens and lists has decreased over earlier versions.  Problems with reports that have existing since the 1990's still exist.  Responsiveness of the application is ridiculously slow as you page or scroll through lists, delete categories, etc - as if none of it was natively programmed.  Old (really old) bugs still exist - such as scheduled transactions not picking up the proper amounts from memorized transactions the first time you enter the payee - have to switch to another payee then back to the intended one, possibly a few times.\\n\\nInstead of fixing old problems, including speed (remember when Quicken was \"quick\"?  I do.)...and report formatting (remember when subtotals were in a different column?, account names were not truncated?  There was space control under subtotals, and more?  Yeah - that was Quicken for DOS in 1990)  they introduced more garish charts, buttons, tabs etc that just complicate the user experience.\\n\\nThey still install (without asking) irritating advertising buttons on your desktop - and of course advertise for more paid services in the product.  Look, if they gave away the product, then they can shove advertising at me in return.  But, we all paid for this.  We should have an 'opt out' box on the installation screen saying \"No, I do not want to be presented with any icons, in-product offers, or e-mails for services from Intuit or any 3rd party.\"  Oh, I cannot count the ways that I hate this corporation...\\n\\nIf there was another product that could convert 100% of Quicken (and Quickbooks) data to allow one to move forward and leave Intuit's products behind ... I would jump ship. Intuit either needs a strong competitor, or to seriously get their act together.\\n---------------------------------\\nUpdate 4/3/2010:  Besides the comments I linked to the original review, I just found a really bad bug (or really stupid change in behavior) that anyone preparing their taxes should be aware of:  For the last 20 years, if you customized a report to show \"Tax-related transactions only\", you would get all transactions for categories that were flagged as 'tax related'.  As of Quicken Deluxe 2010, any such old reports are now broken if you had categories that do not have tax lines assigned to them.  Only those items checked as 'tax related' and which ALSO have a tax line assigned will show up in a tax-filtered report now.  In the past, the tax line assignment was simply a convenience for TurboTax users/importers - and also allowed a tax-line oriented report.  But, it was not required.

Unfortunately, I've now used three different stain removers, washed the items several times and the chalk lines aren't budging!  Now I have a several hundred dollar project that is completely ruined and none of the suggested remedies on quilting sites are working.  I've used a lot of marking pens/chalks/markers in my life and never had this issue before.  Highly disappointed in Dritz.  The only good thing I can say about the chalk is it does mark clear lines.  They are just permanent.

The second problem skein did have some seriously frayed and almost broken plys.\\n\\nI really liked the all over tweed look of the first sock so excitedly jumped into sock two. However I fairly quickly noticed a rather huge difference in the colors, after about 1/3 of the second sock I realized there was a good chance the whole thing would be way off and decided to roll the rest into a ball. Without a doubt the two socks would not have come close to matching.\\n\\nThe first sock had a green strand that went through all of the plys, which is what really gave it that \"tweed\" look that I so liked in that sock. The second skein looks like it might have had the same thing, but for some unknown reason it appears to have been over dyed. So instead of a section of say mostly blue with a touch of green, the same sort of section in the other skein would be relatively solid a blue with maybe a slightly different shade strand of blue. Which means it doesn't look tweed like at all. When I rolled it into a ball I found a couple of seriously ugly muddy parts.\\n\\nMaybe the fact that skein two had so many slightly damaged areas means the over dying is a way to mark the \"bad\" skeins. Either way, they shouldn't be sold with the exact same dye lots.\\n\\nLuckily for me I bought 3 skeins, worrying that two wouldn't be enough, and that third skein looks to Matche the first. I'm extremely disappointed.\\n\\nThe ball pictures show just a couple sections to show how they were solid instead of multi colored with a green strand.

However, I was using it for a scrapbook and a variety of random art projects (e.g., popup cards). Based on my use, I have the following criticisms of the product:\\n\\n(1) PLASTIC ADHESIVE TAPE: This product is best described as tape, not lace. It may be described as paper thin, plastic adhesive. As such, it does not look at all like lace.\\n\\n(2) THIN, SEE-THROUGH: The product is very thin, which causes it to be partially see-through when applied to paper of contrasting color. It also looks rather cheap because it is so thin.\\n\\n(3) IMPERFECT PATTERN: The \"lace\" that is depicted has holes that give it a lace-like pattern. However, the tape did not have all the holes pre-detached. When I peeled it from its backing the holes still did not detach. Therefore, the pattern in the tape looked fairly bad.

       "                   07 15, 2016  A2G6A54VOWKOKY  B00XTM1532  devdevil85     I'm a professional upholstery seamstress and use scissors to cut thick fabrics and zippers almost all day long.  When I saw these on Amazon day for $20 I couldn't resist.  I already had a pair of Carbon Steel scissors which I loved. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00944EWBQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  but they also cost $67 for a 10\" sheer, which to me was worth every penny and then some!\\n\\nThese cheaper sheers are a great deal for the money, but they don't cut through thick fabric quite as effortlessly as the more expensive version.  The handle on these scissors are also not very comfortable and after a day worth of cutting your hands will hurt compared to the other scissors. So ultimately I'm not disappointed I got these scissors and they are a great price for the money, but if your a professional seamstress who uses scissors all day long I'd recommend getting the other carbon steel sheers which cost more.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI've now had these scissors 5 months, and 2-3 months ago the scissors started rusting.  They are now dull and need to be sharpened too.  I keep these next to my sewing machine so they only get used minorly for last minute snips of fabrics.  I purchased another more expensive brand of high carbon steel scissors 7 months ago which I use all day almost every day and they are in perfect condition.  No rust. No need to be sharpened.  I would not recommend these scissors.  I'm glad I only paid $20 for these as they are a waste of money!

When I had it in my hands, I thought that it was beautiful! Then, I opened the manual, and started to discover the diferent functions... on the very fisrt pages came the instructions to lower the feed dogs using a lever on the back of the machine: I lowerd them correctly, but they never did came back up again!\\n\\nI tried a sugestion Singer made to me on the facebook page, and it didn't work. I have to take my machine now to a warranty center, but I feel very disapointed with the quality of this machine.\\n\\nIf someone is in the same situation, these are the instructions they sent me:\\n\\n\"When the feed dogs need to be raised for regular sewing, simply pushing the lever will not raise the feed dogs for you; you must follow these steps to bring the feed dogs to the upper working position.\\n1) Make sure that your presser foot is in the raised (up) position.\\n2) Push the feed dog lever towards the side that indicates the UP position.\\n3) Next manually turn the hand wheel towards you; until you hear the feed dogs click back into place. It is possible that you will not hear the clicking sound, in this case continue turning the hand wheel until you see the feed dogs start to move towards you.\\n\\nYou should now be ready to sew. If the problem persists, you will need to take or ship your machine for service to one of the warranty centers found here.
